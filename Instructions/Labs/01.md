# Getting Started with Azure IoT Services

## Lab Scenario

*Rod pumps (devices)* are deployed across the globe. You need to configure the solution to receive telemetry and manage all the devices centrally in a secure / reliable / scalable fashion.

## In This Lab

In this lab, you will create and examine an Azure IoT Hub and an IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service. The lab includes the following exercises:

* Examine features of the IoT Hub service
* Examine features of the Device Provisioning Service
* Connect device (simulated) to Azure IoT Hub
* Verify telemetry stream from Azure IoT Hub

## Lab Instructions

### Exercise 1: Examine the IoT Hub Service

**Azure IoT Hub** - IoT Hub is a managed service, hosted in the cloud, that acts as a central message hub for bi-directional communication between your IoT application and the devices it manages. You can use Azure IoT Hub to build IoT solutions with reliable and secure communications between millions of IoT devices and a cloud-hosted solution backend. You can connect virtually any device to IoT Hub.

IoT Hub's capabilities help you build scalable, full-featured IoT solutions such as managing industrial equipment used in manufacturing, tracking valuable assets in healthcare, monitoring office building usage, and many more scenarios. IoT Hub monitoring helps you maintain the health of your solution by tracking events such as device creation, device failures, and device connections.

In this exercise, you will examine some of the features that IoT Hub provides. 

#### Task 1: Explore the IoT Hub Overview information

1. If necessary, log in to [portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com) using your Azure account credentials.

    If you have more than one Azure account, be sure that you are logged in with the account that is tied to the subscription that you will be using for this course.

2. Verify that your AZ-220 dashboard is being displayed.

3. On the resource group tile, click **iot-{your-id}**

    When you first open your IoT Hub blade, the **Overview** information will be displayed. As you can see, the area at the top of this blade provides some essential information about your IoT Hub service, such as datacenter location and subscription. But this blade also includes tiles that provide information about how you are using your hub and recent activities. Let's take a look at these tiles before exploring further.

1. At the bottom-left of your IoT Hub blade, notice the **IoT Hub Usage** tile.

    > **Note**:  The tiles positions are based upon the width of the browser window, so the layout may be a little different than described.

    This tile provides a quick overview of what is connected to your hub and message count. As you add devices and start sending messages, this tile will provide nice "at-a-glance" information.

2. To the right of the **IoT Hub Usage** tile, notice the *Device twin operations* tile and the **Device to cloud messages** tile.

    The **Device to cloud messages** tile provides a quick view of the incoming messages from your devices over time. You will be registering a device and sending messages to your hub during a lab in the next module, so you will begin to see information on these tiles pretty soon.

    The **Device twin operations** tile can help you to keep track of device twin access. You will be learning about device twins and device twin operations during the modules of this course that cover device configuration, device provisioning, and device management. For now all you need to know is that each device that you register with your IoT Hub will have a device twin that you can use when you need to manage the device.

#### Task 2: View features of IoT Hub using the left-side menu

1. On the IoT Hub blade, take a minute to scan the left-side menu options.

    As you would expect, these menu options are used to open panes that provide access to properties and features of your IoT Hub. For example, some panes provides access to devices that are connected to your hub.

2. On the left-side menu, under **Explorers**, click **IoT devices**

    This pane can be used to add, modify, and delete devices registered to your hub. You will get pretty familiar with this pane by the end of this course.

3. On the left-side menu, near the top, click **Activity log**

    As the name implies, this pane gives you access to a log that can be used to review activities and diagnose issues. You can also define queries that help with routine tasks. Very handy.

4. On the left-side menu, under **Settings**, click **Built-in endpoints**

    IoT Hub exposes "endpoints" that enable external connections. Essentially, an endpoint is anything connected to or communicating with your IoT Hub. You should see that your hub already has two endpoints defined:

    * _Events_
    * _Cloud to device messaging_

5. On the left-side menu, under **Messaging**, click **Message routing**

    The IoT Hub message routing feature enables you to route incoming device-to-cloud messages to service endpoints such as Azure Storage containers, Event Hubs, and Service Bus queues. You can also create routing rules to perform query-based routes.

6. At the top of the **Message routing** pane, click **Custom endpoints**.

    Custom endpoints (such as Service Bus queue and Storage) are often used within an IoT implementation.

7. Take a minute to scan through the menu options under **Settings**

    > **Note**:  This lab exercise is only intended to be an introduction to the IoT Hub service and get you more comfortable with the UI, so don't worry if you feel a bit overwhelmed at this point. You will be configuring and managing your IoT Hub, devices, and their communications as this course continues.

### Exercise 2: Examine the Device Provisioning Service

The IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service is a helper service for IoT Hub that enables zero-touch, just-in-time provisioning to the right IoT hub without requiring human intervention, enabling customers to provision millions of devices in a secure and scalable manner.

#### Task 1: Explore the Device Provisioning Service Overview information

1. If necessary, log in to [portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com) using your Azure account credentials.

    If you have more than one Azure account, be sure that you are logged in with the account that is tied to the subscription that you will be using for this course.

2. Verify that your AZ-220 dashboard is being displayed.

3. On the **iot-ideployment id** resource group tile, click **iot-{your-id}**

    When you first open your Device Provisioning Service instance, it will display the Overview information. As you can see, the area at the top of the blade provides some essential information about your DPS instance, such as status, datacenter location and subscription. This blade also provides the _Quick Links_ section, which provide access to:

    * [Azure IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-dps/)
    * [Learn more about IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-dps/about-iot-dps)
    * [Device Provisioning concepts](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-dps/concepts-service)
    * [Pricing and scale details](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/iot-hub/)

    When time permits, you can come back and explore these links.

#### Task 2: View features of Device Provisioning Service using the navigation menu

1. Take a minute to scan the left-side menu options.

    As you might expect, these options open panes that provide access to activity logs, properties and feature of the DPS instance.

1. On the left-side menu, near the top, click **Activity log**

    As the name implies, this pane gives you access to a log that can be used to review activities and diagnose issues. You can also define queries that help with routine tasks. Very handy.

1. On the left-side menu, under **Settings**, click **Quick Start**.

    This pane lists the steps to start using the Iot Hub Device Provisioning Service, links to documentation and shortcuts to other blades for configuring DPS.

1. On the left-side menu, under **Settings**, click **Shared access policies**.

    This pane provides management of access policies, lists the existing policies and the associated permissions.

1. On the left-side menu, under **Settings**, click **Linked IoT hubs**.

    Here you can see the linked IoT Hub from earlier. The Device Provisioning Service can only provision devices to IoT hubs that have been linked to it. Linking an IoT hub to an instance of the Device Provisioning service gives the service read/write permissions to the IoT hub's device registry; with the link, a Device Provisioning service can register a device ID and set the initial configuration in the device twin. Linked IoT hubs may be in any Azure region. You may link hubs in other subscriptions to your provisioning service.

1. On the left-side menu, under **Settings**, click **Certificates**.

    Here you can manage the X.509 certificates that can be used to secure your Azure IoT hub using the X.509 Certificate Authentication. You will investigate X.509 certificates in a later lab.

1. On the left-side menu, under **Settings**, click **Manage enrollments**.

    Here you can manage the enrollment groups and individual enrollments.

    Enrollment groups can be used for a large number of devices that share a desired initial configuration, or for devices all going to the same tenant. An enrollment group is a group of devices that share a specific attestation mechanism. Enrollment groups support both X.509 as well as symmetric. All devices in the X.509 enrollment group present X.509 certificates that have been signed by the same root or intermediate Certificate Authority (CA). Each device in the symmetric key enrollment group present SAS tokens derived from the group symmetric key. The enrollment group name and certificate name must be alphanumeric, lowercase, and may contain hyphens.

    An individual enrollment is an entry for a single device that may register. Individual enrollments may use either X.509 leaf certificates or SAS tokens (from a physical or virtual TPM) as attestation mechanisms. The registration ID in an individual enrollment is alphanumeric, lowercase, and may contain hyphens. Individual enrollments may have the desired IoT hub device ID specified.

1. Take a minute to review some of the other menu options under **Settings**

   > **Note**:  This lab exercise is only intended to be an introduction to the IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service and get you more comfortable with the UI, so don't worry if you feel a bit overwhelmed at this point. You will be covering DPS in much more detail as the course continues.

### Exercise 3: Connect device (simulated) to Azure IoT Hub

#### Task 1: Explore the application

1. Get the connection string from the **Environment Details** Tab or you can obtain the connection string by going into IoT Hub, click **Shared Access policies** under settings and then click **iothubowner** under Policy Tab and copy the **Connection string- primarykey** value to establish connection between IoT hub and the Simulator App.

2. Minimize the azure portal and open the **IoT Simulator App** on the desktop. Enter the **Connection string- primarykey** value copied in the previous step to the area provided.

3.Click **Connect** to establish connection.

4. Explore through the Application for **Registering**, **Activating**, **UnRegister**, **Send Telemetry** and so on.

#### Exercise 4: Verify telemetry stream from Azure IoT Hub

In this task, you will use the Azure CLI to verify telemetry sent by the simulated device is being received by Azure IoT Hub.

1. Using a browser, open the [Azure Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com/) and login with the Azure subscription you are using for this course.

2. In the Azure Cloud Shell, to monitor the event messages that are being received by your IoT hub, enter the following command:

    ```cmd/sh
    az iot hub monitor-events --hub-name {IoTHubName} --device-id {Device ID}
    ```

    > **Note**:Be sure to replace both the **{IoTHubName}** and **{Device ID}** placeholder with the name of your Azure IoT Hub and with the Device ID like **Device01**

    > **Note**:  If you receive a message stating _"Dependency update required for IoT extension version"_ when running the Azure CLI command, then press `y` to accept the update and press `Enter`. This will allow the command to continue as expected.

    The `monitor-events` command (within the `az iot hub` Azure CLI module) offers the capability to monitor device telemetry and other message types sent to an Azure IoT Hub. This can be a very useful tool during code development, and the convenience of the command-line interface is also nice.

    The `--device-id` parameter is optional and allows you to monitor the events from a single device. If the parameter is omitted, the command will monitor all events sent to the specified Azure IoT Hub.

3. Notice that the `az iot hub monitor-events` Azure CLI command outputs a JSON representation of the events that are arriving at your specified Azure IoT Hub. 

    This command enables you to monitor the events being sent to IoT hub. You are also verifying that the device is able to connect to and communicate with the your IoT hub.

    You should see messages displayed that are similar to the following:

    ```cmd/sh
    Starting event monitor, filtering on device: sensor-th-0001, use ctrl-c to stop...
    {
        "event": {
            "origin": "Device01",
            "module": "",
            "interface": "",
            "component": "",
            "payload": "{\"id\":\"Device01\",\"time\":\"2020-08-14T12:50:48.4702636Z\",\"temp\":69.0}"
        }
    }
    {
        "event": {
            "origin": "Device01",
            "module": "",
            "interface": "",
            "component": "",
            "payload": "{\"id\":\"Device01\",\"time\":\"2020-08-14T12:48:21.7545040Z\",\"temp\":70.0}"
        }
    }
    ```

4. Once you have verified that IoT hub is receiving the telemetry, press **Ctrl-C** in the Azure Cloud Shell and Visual Studio Code windows.

    Ctrl-C is used to stop the running apps. Always remember to shut down unneeded apps and jobs.
