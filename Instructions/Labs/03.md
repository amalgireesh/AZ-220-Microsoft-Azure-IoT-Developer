# Azure IoT Hub and Azure ML 

## Lab Scenario

Your hard work implementing Azure IoT services and tools has paid off. Contoso has rolled out their "Asset Condition Tracking System" that monitors the environmental conditions of cheese containers during shipment.

Two weeks after launching the new system it has revealed a temperature spike in-transit for a specific shipment. Some of the cheese in the shipment was ruined, but the new system did ensure that the affected cheese wasn't delivered to the customer. Since you know the Azure IoT side of the monitoring system better than anyone, you will lead the investigation.

Management has asked you to determine if the system can be improved, hopefully to the point where it will prevent the loss of product in the future. You correlate the IoT devices' sensor data taken from the trucks and planes used during the shipment. It appears that the temperature in one of the trucks rose unexpectedly in a particular area of the vehicle and created the heat spike in one of the transport containers (which was equipped with an IoT device monitoring temperature and humidity).

Your team decides that further improvements to the monitoring system will require near real-time data exploration and root-cause analysis.

You propose adding Time Series Insights to the Azure IoT solution. This will enable Contoso to quickly store, visualize, and query the large amounts of time series data that are generated by the IoT devices in the trucks, planes, and containers, and to visualize changes over time. 

The following resources will be created:

### Exercise 1: Run Simulated IoT Devices

#### Task 1: Update the SQL query for the Job

1. On the left-side menu under **Job topology**, click **Query**.

1. Copy the following SQL query, and then paste it *above* the existing short query.

    ```sql
    WITH AnomalyDetectionStep AS
    (
        SELECT
            EVENTENQUEUEDUTCTIME AS time,
            CAST(vibration AS float) AS vibe,
            AnomalyDetection_SpikeAndDip(CAST(vibration AS float), 95, 120, 'spikesanddips')
                OVER(LIMIT DURATION(second, 120)) AS SpikeAndDipScores
        FROM vibrationEventInput
    )
    SELECT
        time,
        vibe,
        CAST(GetRecordPropertyValue(SpikeAndDipScores, 'Score') AS float) AS
        SpikeAndDipScore,
        CAST(GetRecordPropertyValue(SpikeAndDipScores, 'IsAnomaly') AS bigint) AS
        IsSpikeAndDipAnomaly
    INTO vibrationBI
    FROM AnomalyDetectionStep
    ```

    > **Note**:  This first section of this query takes the vibration data, and examines the previous 120 seconds worth. The `AnomalyDetection_SpikeAndDip` function will return a `Score` parameter, and an `IsAnomaly` parameter. The score is how certain the ML model is that the given value is an anomaly, specified as a percentage. If the score exceeds 95%, the `IsAnomaly` parameter has a value of 1, otherwise `IsAnomaly` has a value of 0. Notice the 120 and 95 parameters in the first section of the query. The second section of the query sends the time, vibration, and anomaly parameters to `vibrationBI`.

1. Verify that the query editor now lists 2 Inputs and Outputs:

    * `Inputs`
      * `vibrationEventInput`
      * `vibrationInput`
    * `Outputs`
      * `vibrationBI`
      * `vibrationOutput`

    If you see more than 2 of each then you likely have a typo in your query or in the name you used for the input or output - correct the issue before moving on.

1. To save the query, click **Save query**.

1. On the left-side menu, click **Overview**.

1. Near the top of the blade, click **Start**.

1. On the **Start job** pane, under **Job output start time**, ensure **Now** is selected, and then click **Start**.

In order for a human operator to easily interpret the output from this query, you need to visualize the data in a friendly way. One way of doing this visualization is to create a Power BI dashboard.

### Exercise 7: Create a Power BI Dashboard

Now for the final part of the scenario - the actual data visualization. You have updated your job to process the vibration telemetry via the ML model and output the results to Power BI. Within Power BI, you need to create a dashboard with a number of tiles to visualize the results and provide decision support for the operator.

#### Task 1: Create a New Dashboard

1. In your browser, navigate to [https://app.powerbi.com/](https://app.powerbi.com/).

1. Once Power BI has opened, on the left-side navigation menu, expand **Workspaces**, and then select the workspace that you specified above.

    > **Note**:  At the time of writing, Power BI has a *New Look* in preview. The steps in this task have been written assuming the *New Look* is **Off**. To turn off the *New Look*, on the toolbar at the top of the screen, ensure that the toggle reads **New look off**. 

1. On the **Datasets** tab, verify that **vibrationDataset** is displayed.

    If not, you might have to wait a short time for this list to populate.

1. At the top right of the page, click **+ Create**, and then click **Dashboard**.

1. In the **Create dashboard** popup, under **Dashboard name**, type **Vibration Dash** and then click **Create**.

    The new dashboard will be displayed as an essentially blank page.

#### Task 2: Add the Vibration Gauge Tile

1. To add a vibration gauge, at the top of the blank dashboard, click **+ Add tile**.

1. In the **Add tile** pane, under **REAL-TIME DATA**, click **Custom Streaming Data**, and then click **Next**.

1. On the **Add a custom streaming data tile** pane, under **YOUR DATASETS**, click **vibrationDataset**, and then click **Next**.

    The pane will refresh to allow you to choose a visualization type and fields.

1. Under **Vibration Type**, open the dropdown, and then click **Gauge**.

    Notice that changing the visualization type changes the fields below.

1. Under **Value**, click **+ Add value**, open the dropdown, and then click **Vibe**.

    Notice that the gauge appears immediately on the dashboard with a value that begins to update!

1. To display the Tile details pane, click **Next**.

1. In the **Tile details** pane, under **Title**, enter **Vibration**.

1. To leave the remaining fields at default values and close the pane, click **Apply**.

    If you see a notification about creating a phone view, you can ignore it and it will disappear shortly (or dismiss it yourself).

1. To reduce the size of the tile, hover your mouse over the bottom-right corner of the tile, and then click-and-drag the resize mouse pointer.

    Make the tile as small as you can. It will snap to various preset sizes.

#### Task 3: Add the SpikeAndDipScore Clustered Bar Chart Tile

1. To add the SpikeAndDipScore Clustered Bar Chart, at the top of the dashboard, click **+ Add tile**.

1. In the **Add tile** pane, under **REAL-TIME DATA**, click **Custom Streaming Data**, and then click **Next**.

1. On the **Add a custom streaming data tile** pane, under **YOUR DATASETS**, click **vibrationDataset**, and then click **Next**.

1. Under **Visualization Type**, open the dropdown, and then click **Clustered bar chart**.

    Notice that changing the visualization type changes the fields below.

1. Under **Value**, click **+ Add value**, open the dropdown, and then click **SpikeAndDipScore**.

1. To display the Tile details pane, click **Next**.

1. To close Tile details pane, click **Apply**.

    If you see a notification about creating a phone view, you can ignore it and it will disappear shortly (or dismiss it yourself).

1. Again, reduce the size of the tile, making it as small as you can.

#### Task 4: Add the IsSpikeAndDipAnomaly Card Tile

1. At the top of the dashboard, to add a IsSpikeAndDipAnomaly Card visualization, click **+ Add tile**.

1. In the **Add tile** pane, under **REAL-TIME DATA**, click **Custom Streaming Data**, and then click **Next**.

1. On the **Add a custom streaming data tile** pane, under **YOUR DATASETS**, click **vibrationDatset**, and then click **Next**.

1. Under **Visualization Type**, open the dropdown, and then click **Card**.

1. Under **Value**, click **+ Add value**, open the dropdown, and then click **IsSpikeAndDipAnomaly**.

1. To display the Tile details pane, click **Next**.

1. In the **Tile details** pane, under **Title**, enter **Is anomaly?**

1. To close the Tile details pane, click **Apply**.

    If you see a notification about creating a phone view, you can ignore it and it will disappear shortly (or dismiss it yourself).

1. Again, reduce the size of the tile, making it as small as you can.

#### Task 5: Rearrange the Tiles

1. Using drag-and-drop, arrange the tiles vertically on the left of the dashboard in the following order:

    * SpikeAndDipScore
    * Is Anomaly?
    * Vibration

#### Task 6: Add Anomalies Over The Hour Line Chart Tile

Now to create a fourth tile, the `Anomalies Over the Hour` line chart.  This one is a bit more complex.

1. At the top of the dashboard, click **+ Add tile**.

1. In the **Add tile** pane, under **REAL-TIME DATA**, click **Custom Streaming Data**, and then click **Next**.

1. On the **Add a custom streaming data tile** pane, under **YOUR DATASETS**, click **vibrationDataset**, and then click **Next**.

    The pane will refresh to allow you to choose a visualization type and fields.

1. Under **Visualization Type**, open the dropdown, and then click **Line chart**.

    Notice that changing the visualization type changes the fields below.

1. Under **Axis**, click **+ Add value**, and then select **time** from the dropdown.

1. Under **Values**, click **+ Add value**, and then select **IsSpikeAndDipAnomaly** from the dropdown.

    Notice that the chart appears immediately on the dashboard with a value that begins to update!

1. Under **Time window to display**, to the right of **Last**, open the dropdown, and then click **60**

    Leave the units set to **Minutes**.

1. To display the Tile details pane, click **Next**.

1. In the **Tile details** pane, under **Title**, enter **Anomalies over the hour**.

1. To close the Tile details pane, click **Apply**.

    If you see a notification about creating a phone view, you can ignore it and it will disappear shortly (or dismiss it yourself).

1. This time, stretch the tile so its height matches the 3 tiles to the left and its width fits the remaining space of the dashboard.

    There is a latency with so many routes and connections, but you should start seeing the vibration data in the visualizations

    > **Note**:  If no data appears, check you are running the device app and the analytics job is running.

    Let the job run for a while, several minutes at least before the ML model will kick in. Compare the console output of the device app, with the Power BI dashboard. Are you able to correlate the forced and increasing vibrations to a run of anomaly detections?

If you're seeing an active Power BI dashboard, you've just completed this lab. Great work.
